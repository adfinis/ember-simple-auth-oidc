A [Ember Simple Auth](http://ember-simple-auth.com) addon which implements the
OpenID Connect [Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth).

## Installation

- Ember.js v4.4 or above
- Ember CLI v4.4 or above
- Node.js v16 or above

Note: The addon uses [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
in its implementation, if IE browser support is necessary, a polyfill needs to be provided.

```bash
$ ember install ember-simple-auth-oidc
```

If you're upgrading from 3.x to 4.x see the [upgrade guide](docs/migration-v4.md).

## Usage

To use the oidc authorization code flow the following elements need to be added
to the Ember application.

The login / authentication route (for example the Ember Simple Auth default `/login`)
needs to extend from the `OIDCAuthenticationRoute`, which handles the authentication
procedure. In case the user is already authenticated, the transition is aborted.

```js
// app/routes/login.js

import OIDCAuthenticationRoute from "ember-simple-auth-oidc/routes/oidc-authentication";

export default class LoginRoute extends OIDCAuthenticationRoute {}
```

Authenticated routes need to call `session.requireAuthentication` in their
respective `beforeModel`, to ensure that unauthenticated transitions are
prevented and redirected to the authentication route. It's recommended to 
await the `beforeModel` hook, to make sure authentication is handled before
other API calls are triggered (which might lead to `401` responses, potentially
causing redirect loops).

```js
// app/routes/protected.js

import Route from "@ember/routing/route";
import { inject as service } from "@ember/service";

export default class ProtectedRoute extends Route {
  @service session;

  async beforeModel(transition) {
    await this.session.requireAuthentication(transition, "login");
  }
}
```

To include authorization info in all Ember Data requests override `headers` in
the application adapter and include `session.headers` alongside any other
necessary headers. By extending the application adapter from either of the
provided `OIDCJSONAPIAdapter` or `OIDCRESTAdapter`, the `access_token` is
refreshed before Ember Data requests, if necessary. Both the `OIDCJSONAPIAdapter`
and the `OIDCRESTAdapter` also provide default headers with the authorization
header included.

```js
// app/adapters/application.js

import { inject as service } from "@ember/service";
import OIDCJSONAPIAdapter from "ember-simple-auth-oidc/adapters/oidc-json-api-adapter";

export default class ApplicationAdapter extends OIDCJSONAPIAdapter {
  @service session;

  get headers() {
    return { ...this.session.headers, "Content-Language": "en-us" };
  }
}
```

`ember-simple-auth-oidc` also provides a middleware which handles authorization
and unauthorization on the apollo service provided by `ember-apollo-client`.
Simply, wrap the http link in `apolloMiddleware` like so:

```js
// app/services/apollo.js

import { inject as service } from "@ember/service";
import ApolloService from "ember-apollo-client/services/apollo";
import { apolloMiddleware } from "ember-simple-auth-oidc";

export default class CustomApolloService extends ApolloService {
  @service session;

  link() {
    const httpLink = super.link();

    return apolloMiddleware(httpLink, this.session);
  }
}
```

The provided adapters and the apollo middleware already handle authorization and
unauthorized requests properly. If you want the same behaviour for other request
services as well, you can use the `handleUnauthorized` function and the
`refreshAuthentication.perform` method on the session. The following snippet
shows an example of a custom fetch service with proper authentication handling:

```js
import Service, { inject as service } from "@ember/service";
import { handleUnauthorized } from "ember-simple-auth-oidc";
import fetch from "fetch";

export default class FetchService extends Service {
  @service session;

  async fetch(url) {
    await this.session.refreshAuthentication.perform();

    const response = await fetch(url, { headers: this.session.headers });

    if (!response.ok && response.status === 401) {
      handleUnauthorized(this.session);
    }

    return response;
  }
}
```

Ember Simple Auth encourages the manual setup of the session service in the `beforeModel` of the
application route, starting with [version 4.1.0](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/releases/tag/4.1.0).
The relevant changes are described in their [upgrade to v4 guide](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/blob/master/guides/upgrade-to-v4.md).

### Logout / Explicit invalidation

There are two ways to invalidate (logout) the current session:

```js
session.invalidate();
```

The session `invalidate` method ends the current ember-simple-auth session and therefore performs a
logout on the ember application. Note that the session on the authorization server is not invalidated
this way and a new token/session can simply be obtained when doing the authentication process again.

```js
session.singleLogout();
```

The session `singleLogout` method will invalidate the current ember-simple-auth session and after that
call the `end-session` endpoint of the authorization server. This will result in a logout of the
ember application and additionally invalidate the session on the authorization server which will logout
the user of all applications using this authorization server!

## Configuration

The addon can be configured in the project's `environment.js` file with the key `ember-simple-auth-oidc`.

A minimal configuration includes the following options:

```js
// config/environment.js

module.exports = function (environment) {
  let ENV = {
    // ...
    "ember-simple-auth-oidc": {
      host: "http://authorization.server/openid",
      clientId: "test",
      authEndpoint: "/authorize",
      tokenEndpoint: "/token",
      userinfoEndpoint: "/userinfo",
    },
    // ...
  };
  return ENV;
};
```

Here is a complete list of all possible config options:

**host** `<String>`  
A relative or absolute URI of the authorization server.

**clientId** `<String>`  
The oidc client identifier valid at the authorization server.

**authEndpoint** `<String>`  
Authorization endpoint at the authorization server. This can be a path which
will be appended to `host` or an absolute URL.

**tokenEndpoint** `<String>`  
Token endpoint at the authorization server. This can be a path which will be
appended to `host` or an absolute URL.

**endSessionEndpoint** `<String>` (optional)  
End session endpoint endpoint at the authorization server. This can be a path
which will be appended to `host` or an absolute URL.

**userinfoEndpoint** `<String>`  
Userinfo endpoint endpoint at the authorization server. This can be a path
which will be appended to `host` or an absolute URL.

**afterLogoutUri** `<String>` (optional)  
A relative or absolute URI to which will be redirected after logout / end session.

**scope** `<String>` (optional)  
The oidc scope value. Default is `"openid"`.

**expiresIn** `<Number>` (optional)  
Milliseconds after which the token expires. This is only a fallback value if the authorization server does not return a `expires_in` value. Default is `3600000` (1h).

**refreshLeeway** `<Number>` (optional)  
Milliseconds before expire time at which the token is refreshed. Default is `30000` (30s).

**tokenPropertyName** `<String>` (optional)  
Name of the property which holds the token in a successful authenticate request. Default is `"access_token"`.

**authHeaderName** `<String>` (optional)  
Name of the authentication header holding the token used in requests. Default is `"Authorization"`.

**authPrefix** `<String>` (optional)  
Prefix of the authentication token. Default is `"Bearer"`.

**loginHintName** `<String>` (optional)  
Name of the `login_hint` query paramter which is being forwarded to the authorization server if it is present. This option allows overriding the default name `login_hint`.

**amountOfRetries** `<Number>` (optional)  
Amount of retries should be made if the request to fetch a new token fails. Default is `3`.

**retryTimeout** `<Number>` (optional)  
Timeout in milliseconds between each retry if a token refresh should fail. Default is `3000`.

**enablePkce** `<Boolean>` (optional)
Enables PKCE mechanism to provide additional protection during code to token exchanges. Default is `false`.

**unauthorizedRequestRedirectTimeout** `<Number>` (optional)
Debounce timeout for redirection after (multiple) `401` responses are received to prevent redirect loops (at the cost of a small delay). Set to `0` to disable debouncing. Default is `1000`.
